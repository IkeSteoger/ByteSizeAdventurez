## About the Application

    - This is an app for pre-school kids around the world to entertain themselves without parental supervision. The idea is to have an app that allows kids to go through the website on their own and discover a few different pathways of interactivity such as: a splash page with a question of picking their favorite color and having the page show up as that color, clicking on a picture that links them to their favorite videos, a separate page for to a physics based game, and a rewards/progress tracker so that they can view what they've done the next time they access the website! 

    Although this application is primarily designed to be used with the english language, there is minimal text so that it is possible to be used in any language.
