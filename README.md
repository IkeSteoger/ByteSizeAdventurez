## Group Project: Team Agreement


### Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

Start the day with a stand-up meeting in Remo or Slack

Open Asana and review tasks, open new ticket items, prioritize and assign

Review wire frame 


### Team Member - Strengths- Competencies You Want to Develop

Heather Holcomb- UI/UX, Product Mgmt, Design - Logic & data mapping

Francisco Sanchez - Logic, JavaScript - Time Mgmt, Design

Kyle White - Ideation, Re-Factoring, Organization - JS libraries integration

Ike Steoger - HTML, JavaScript - DOM usage!


NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.


### Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Open communication amongst team members. Bring up professional conflicts to the group.

Clarify roles & responsibilities - who is doing what? 

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

Communicate in stand up and reassess as a team

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Team effort - pick up user stories that fit where you’re at & speak up when you need help

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Communicate in stand up - if it’s a blocker call it out and reassess ownership.

If it’s not a blocker - let them get a bad grade for their individual effort. 

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

Bring concerns to Jacob at the end of the working day if conflicts are not resolved internally. 


### Communication Plan

### Communication Channels

Slack - https://codefellows.slack.com/archives/C050A7QNX4L 

GH Org - https://github.com/code201d98-Team1 

Asana - https://app.asana.com/0/1204261154812151/1204261154812151 

Invision - https://kylewhite378860.invisionapp.com/freehand/201-Final-Project-Wireframe--Team-1-97fYoxM[…]95d485b2a6e3239544edf1214c28c7f80236d6c91fccc8a8b0ca1

Describe at least:

What hours will you be available to communicate?

9-6 Monday - Friday (Heather, Ike, Kyle PST, Francisco MST)

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack, Remo

How often will you take breaks?

Every hour 10 min. If everyone is down we take a hype break, play Pump up the Jam for 30 seconds.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Lean on your teammates, share resources, grab a TA or a therapist

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Slack

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Open floor policy

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Don’t be a jerk

### Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
Describe at least:

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Use Asana’s built in functionality to create task cards and assign them, in-progress the cards, and then complete and stack into finalized area. Use morning stand-ups to compile a list of tasks, organize them by priority, assign them and manage unfinished tasks.

Good communication - talk to your teammates!

What project management tool will be used?

Asana project management tool - https://app.asana.com/0/1204261154812151/1204261154812151 

### Presentation Deck

### Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.

When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.

Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

### Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

What components of your project will live on GitHub? (*)

Main branch > development branch > each code sprint day 4 separate feature branches per user or task if we’re tag teaming a feature. 

How will you share the repository with your teammates?

Heather created and org, we all have full access. Use terminal to view, create, and merge pulls.

https://github.com/code201d98-Team11d98-Team1 

What is your Git flow?

Each day create feature branches for individual users to code and maintain, then upon communicating a desire to push, pull and merge we gain agreement, review, and throw the changes onto the development branch.

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

How many people must review a PR?

1 other person reviews PR

Who merges PRs?

Person reviewing

How often will you merge?

Anytime we finish a major feature, need to come back to a feature if it’s unfinished and need eyes on code review, at least twice a day.
How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

We’ll be in communication during working hours
